Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:

    docker build -t nbn-container-repo .

    docker tag nbn-container-repo:latest 438465144115.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nbn-container-repo:latest

Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
